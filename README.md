----- Notes --------
- when varaiale of funtion have yello waved undderline means that this variable still not used yet
- '' : considered as a value
- push & filter & splice does not update state only affect on arrray and you should setState after using these methods
- if the key value we can type only one of them  { courses : courses}  => {courses}
- we make funcitions in one component and put it in the path of other components by props
- splice method the same like filter 
- input => defaultValue ="test" attribute
- input => ref ={} attribute   => store the value of input
